Exploring and comparing popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools by implementing the same reference cloud infrastructure using each of them.

## Why this project?

Building the *same* cloud stack with several IaC tools is the fastest way to understand:
* authoring experience & language choices  
* state management  
* ecosystem maturity (providers, modules, multi-environments)  
* testing and CI/CD  
* operational concerns‚Äîspeed, cost, reviewability

`iac-comparator` gathers these learnings in one codebase.

## 1. Reference Architecture 

This section provides a **visual representation of the AWS infrastructure**, chosen as reference for this project, outlining and describing key components. It allows to understand the high-level architecture and how different services interact with each other.

![AWS_Infrastructure_Diagram](./images/infrastructure_diagram.png)

Here‚Äôs a short description of the services presented in the infrastructure diagram:

- **VPC and subnets**: The infrastructure is deployed in a VPC with multiple subnets (public and private) for various purposes:
    - **Public Subnets (A, B, C)**: Host services that need direct access to the internet, such as the Network or Application Load Balancer, which distributes incoming traffic to the backend services inside the EKS Cluster.
    - **Private Subnets (A, B, C)**: Dedicated for backend services like the AWS EKS Cluster (Elastic Kubernetes Service) with no direct internet access.
- **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: EKS manages the containerized application workloads and other platform-related services for example Grafana for dashboarding, Prometheus for metrics, Loki for logging, and ArgoCD as GitOps tool.
- **EC2 Bastion Host**: TODO
- **Security & Management Services**:
    - IAM Roles for giving specific permissions within AWS to role assumers.
    - KMS (Key Management Service) which allows to encrypt/decrypt sensitive data.

\*A **Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment** is utilized across all services to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
